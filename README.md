athena-dbg
==========

``athena-dbg`` is a simple wrapper around ``github.com/sirnewton01/godbg`` with (hopefully) sensible defaults for athena debugging.

## installation

Once you have a working ``go`` toolchain installed (see [go-doc](http://golang.org/doc/install)), the following should just work:

```sh
$ go get github.com/atlas-org/athena-dbg
```

## Usage

Then, in your usual ``athena/asetup`` environment:

```sh
$ athena-dbg myjobo.py
```

should just work (TM).
